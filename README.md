<p>SIEM is a solution that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats before they harm business operations.</p>
<p>Honeypots are cybersecurity mechanisms intentionally designed to look like legitimate targets (e.g., software applications, servers, or network components). Honeypots resemble attractive targets (e.g., payment gateways, databases, sensitive information).</p>
